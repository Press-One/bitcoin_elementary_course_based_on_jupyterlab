      Hi source code lover,

      you're a curious person and a fast learner ;)

            <p>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively<strong>（排他的）</strong>on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the <strong>trust based model</strong>. Completely nonreversible<strong>（不可逆的）</strong> transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary<strong>（谨慎的）</strong> of their customers, hassling<strong>（找麻烦）</strong> them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud<strong>（欺骗）</strong> is accepted as unavoidable.
